What game you're going to make.
	BlackJack
What are the rules of the game.
	Player vs Dealer(Computer)
	Player has to obtain a hand bigger than the dealers.
	Values 2-10 are their own values.
	J, Q, K are values of 10.
	A is a value of 1 or 11.
Your plan of how to make it (design choices).
	Signaling when to Hit or Stand (Use buttons)
	Splitting Pairs 
		(Use arrays, and probably .split to make a new array which is the other hand and evaluate the value constantly)
	Doubling Down
		(Conditional; total count of hand equals 9-11, then Double Down button is enabled to have the option of being toggled. A random value will then be dealt unknown to the player.)
	Insurance
		(Conditional; Dealer's known value is an Ace, Insurance button is enabled allowing to be toggled)
	Reshuffling
		(Keep total count of available cards[array] until it reaches 0)
